**Introduction**
-------------

As part of the Mobile Applications Development I was tasked with creating a Windows UWP app. The app I decided to create is an Interval time Trainging app. This app could be used by athletes in keeping track of their times when out on a run. The application is designed to give you split times so you keep pushing yourself as you work out. It allows the user to set a goal time and only when they have pushed hard and clicked the button will they know if they have reached their goal.
